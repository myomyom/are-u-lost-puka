# About

Mini map visualization project.
Uses Python (Flask, Folium, Pandas), HTML, & Bootstrap.
Data from [SNCF API](https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/objets-trouves-gares/information/).

## Misc

I originally wanted to add a filter feature based on the month/year, but I decided to implement it in another project with my own database (lmao)
